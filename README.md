### Prerequisites

- **Java Development Kit (JDK) 11** or higher is required.
- A Java-compatible IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, VS Code) is recommended.

### Project Structure

The project follows a standard Maven-like directory layout:

- `src/main/java`: Source code (organized in `com.checkmate` packages).
- `src/main/resources`: Game resources (images, fonts).
- `bin`: Compiled class files (generated after running `run.sh`).

### Steps to Run

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
